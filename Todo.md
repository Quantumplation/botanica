# Done
 - Sky
 - Ground
 - Fade in ground
 - Rolling hills
 - Camera move up and down
 - Click+Drag roots
 - Root offshoots
 - Stems upward
 - Roots gather minerals
 - Roots gather water
 - Stems consume water
 - Can't go through rocks
 - Small polish
   - Camera min/max height for ~exploration~
   - show plant height/depth
 - Roots can't grow above ground
 - Resource patches deplete over time
 - Space bits!
 - If you don't have enough water, bits of plant start dying
 - If you have too much water, bits of root start dying

# TODO


 - Rates of gather / expend
 - Resources are bottlenecked by root width
 - Worms to deposit resources
 - Dead animals to deposit big resources
 - Plant parts above ground to sway slightly
 - Day/night cycle, position of sun changes
 - Ants to come eat roots
 - Rain, and increase moisture of ground
 - Seed -> "Factory" upgrade
   - once you have enough roots / shoots, seed is replaced with a factory area
 - "Mineral Painting" tool
   - You can paint down minerals, and it will thicken up the plant
   - Place down enough, and it hardens like wood/bark
 - "Factory" area produces photosynthesis cells out of minerals
 - "Paint" down photosynthesis cells to make leaves to gather sun
 - "Factory" area produces proto-seeds out of sunlight
 - "Paint" down proto-seeds to produce seeds
 - More roots => more stable
 - Plant can get ripped up by wind!
 - Moving plant bits -> adjust for sun etc., costs energy
 - Flowers / Fruits?
 - Bees?
